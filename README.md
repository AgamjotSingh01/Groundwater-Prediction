🌍 Groundwater Level Prediction API
This project is a Flask-based API that leverages machine learning to predict groundwater levels based on historical data. It is designed to assist in water resource management, providing valuable insights for farmers, policymakers, and researchers.

🚀 Features
Machine Learning Model: Predicts groundwater levels using historical data.
Flask API: Handles requests and serves predictions efficiently.
React Frontend: Provides an interactive UI for users.
Data Processing & Feature Engineering: Cleans and prepares data for better model accuracy.
Time Series Forecasting: Uses models like LSTM and CNN for predictive insights.
CSV-Based Data Handling: Reads and processes data from data.csv.
CORS Enabled: Ensures smooth frontend-backend communication.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning (Random Forest, LSTM, CNN)
React (Frontend UI)
REST API Integration
🔧 Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/groundwater-prediction-api.git
cd groundwater-prediction-api
Install dependencies:
sh
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask server:
sh
Copy
Edit

Start the React frontend (if applicable).
📌 API Usage
Send a POST request to /predict with JSON data:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "state": "Uttar Pradesh_9",
  "district": "Baghpat_124",
  "block": "Pilana_893",
  "rainfall_status": "yes",
  "aquifer_type": "Unconfined"
}
The API will return a groundwater level prediction along with performance metrics.
